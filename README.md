## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the Store manager to understand their customers better. It helps the owner of store to know if their customers are satisfied with their services.Also, it will help to strategize the sales department to formulate their way to increase sales by looking on key measure as showed in dashboard.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into excel, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : For calculating age, we have given several criteria using IFS function.
- step 5 : From Date column we have extracted Month using Text function
- Step 6 : Created pivot tables and pivot charts for criterias e.g: Sales across States, age ,platform etc.
- Step 7 : Visual filters (Slicers were added for four fields named "States", "Age", "Gender","Channel").
